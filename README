Overview
===

This was a random side project to experiment with Backbone, Bootstrap through with a single page site + responsive designing. Putting it up on GitHub as I don't have any plans on putting it into production at this point.

It has 3 parts:

zapfolio - Core platform
zapfolio-shared - Shared modules between the two parts
zapfolio-portfolio - Actual portfolio rendering and management
