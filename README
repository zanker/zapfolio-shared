Overview
===

This was a random side project to experiment with Bootstrap that I'm putting up since I don't have any plans to use it in production at this point.

It has 3 parts:

zapfolio - Core platform
zapfolio-shared - Shared modules between the two parts
zapfolio-portfolio - Actual portfolio rendering and management
